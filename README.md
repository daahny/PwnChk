# PwnChk
### Burner email data breach status checker.

PwnChk checks the status of multiple burner emails to see if they have been breached.<br />
This is especially useful for those with numerous burner emails.<br />
Instead of checking the breach status of 200 different burner emails one at a time,
this script can accept a CSV file of burner emails and check the breach status
of each email using the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API.
